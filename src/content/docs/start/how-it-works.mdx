### How It Works

Here’s a breakdown of how the IEEEXtreme competition operates:

- **Team Composition**: Each team must consist of up to three IEEE student members, and a proctor who oversees the team during the competition.
  > A proctor can oversee multiple teams, and usually is 1 proctor per University.
- **Problem Statements**: Teams are presented with multiple problem statements that they need to solve within the 24-hour period. These problems cover a wide range of topics, from basic algorithms to complex data structures.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on the correctness and efficiency of the solutions. Some problems may carry more points than others, depending on their difficulty level.
- **Languages and Tools**: Participants are allowed to use any programming language or tool they are comfortable with, as long as they adhere to the rules of the competition.
- **Monitoring and Support**: The competition is monitored online, and teams receive updates and support through various communication channels set up by the organizers.

The results are usually announced shortly after the competition ends, followed by the distribution of awards and prizes to the top-performing teams.

## Understanding Competitive Programming

To fully appreciate the scope and intensity of IEEEXtreme, it’s essential to understand what competitive programming involves.

### What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive programming is a mind sport in which participants are required to solve well-defined problems by writing efficient algorithms within a stipulated time frame. These problems can range from simple coding tasks to complex algorithmic challenges that require in-depth knowledge of mathematics, computer science, and various data structures.

### Key Elements of Competitive Programming

Here are some of the fundamental aspects of competitive programming:

- **Problem Solving**: The core of competitive programming lies in problem-solving. Participants are given a set of problems, and they must devise an optimal solution using algorithms and data structures.
- **Efficiency**: It’s not just about finding a solution but finding the most efficient one. This includes optimizing the time and space complexity of the algorithm.
- **Coding Skills**: Strong coding skills are a must, as participants need to implement their solutions in various programming languages.
- **Speed**: Competitive programming often involves time constraints, requiring participants to think and code quickly.
- **Teamwork**: In team competitions like IEEEXtreme, collaboration and communication are crucial for success.

Competitive programming is widely popular and serves as a training ground for coding interviews, problem-solving skills, and algorithmic thinking.

## How IEEEXtreme Works

IEEEXtreme is a 24-hour coding competition where up to 23 problems will be released for participants to solve. These problems are introduced periodically, with new challenges being made available every 1 to 2 hours. You are expected to work on the problems as they are released, but there’s no strict time limit for submitting each solution within the 24-hour window. For example, you can submit a solution to a problem released in the first hour at any point before the competition ends.

All solutions must be submitted through [CSAcademy](https://csacademy.com). If you’ve used coding platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank before, you'll find CSAcademy quite familiar.

### What Languages Can Be Used?

You are free to use any programming language supported by CSAcademy, which includes all major languages such as Python, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, and even COBOL. For languages like Python, which have an interpreted runtime, the platform will automatically adjust the time limits, allowing more time compared to faster-compiled languages like C. This ensures that no language gives a competitive advantage, and success is based solely on problem-solving and optimization skills.

### How Does Scoring Work?

When you submit your solution on CSAcademy, it undergoes several checks, which are categorized as follows:

1. **Accuracy**
   Your code is tested against a set of predefined test cases. The more test cases your solution passes, the higher your score for that problem.

2. **Time Limit**
   Your code must execute within a specified time limit, which is adjusted depending on the language used.

3. **Memory Limit**
   Your solution must use an optimal amount of memory. If it exceeds the allocated memory limit, you may lose points.

> Please note that submitting a solution multiple times for the same problem will result in a reduction in the maximum score you can achieve for that problem.
