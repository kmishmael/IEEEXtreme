## An Introduction to IEEEXtreme Competition

### What is IEEEXtreme?

IEEEXtreme is an annual, global, 24-hour programming competition organized by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). This unique event gathers teams of IEEE student members from around the globe to compete against each other in solving programming and algorithmic challenges. Participants come from diverse backgrounds, including computer science, information technology, and other engineering disciplines.

The competition is not just a test of coding skills but also of endurance, as it runs non-stop for 24 hours. During this period, teams are presented with problems of varying difficulty levels, which they must solve to score points. The team with the highest score at the end of the 24-hour period is declared the winner.

### History and Evolution

IEEEXtreme was first held in 2006 and has since grown exponentially in both scale and participation. What began as a regional contest has now evolved into a global phenomenon, with thousands of students and hundreds of universities participating each year. The competition aims to foster a sense of community and collaboration among IEEE members, while providing a platform for them to showcase their problem-solving skills.
